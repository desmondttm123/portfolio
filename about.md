# About Me
![Profile Image](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQjuWjlj6CwEyvxhr4pRuh4Eo66cDb_nGW1kLRK6-8Stw&s)

I am Desmond, an enthusiast in electronics design, robotics, and 3D design. I discovered my passion for electronics when I was introduced to an Arduino at the age of 18 and have loved it ever since. I have participated in events such as ant and beetle weight robot wars, 24-hour hackathons, and innovation competitions. I built this site to document some of the fun things I have done.

It is my ethos that all designs should be not only functional but also elegant. I take pride in my designs and ensure they have standards at every level. I hope to showcase some of my work in this site!

## My Journey

My journey in designing began when I was young, and I have continued to develop my skills through education, my full time job as an engineer and hands-on experience. 


## Tools I often use

- Schematic Creation tools (Autodesk Eagle, Cadance, Mentor Graphics)
- 3D Design (Autodesk Inventor, Autodesk Fushion)
- Simulation Tools (MATLAB, CST, Hyperlynx, Gazebo)
- Programming Languages (C, C++, Python)
